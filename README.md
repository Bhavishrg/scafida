Local Area Network(LAN) is a computer network that is confined to small areas like offices, schools, colleges
etc. A local area network usually consists of PCs,routers, switches, Network Interface Cards and server. The
arrangement of these components is important while setting up a local area network. This arrangement is
called LAN Topology. Poor arrangement could result in loss of all connections due to failures of some nodes.
Most existing LAN topologies are not tolerant to such failures. The goal here is to analyse scale-free network
generation algorithm used for generating data center topology and apply on LANs to generate LAN Topology.
For this purpose we study the Scafida algorithm inspired from Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment
wherein the node degree is limited to meet the physical constrain of network components while maintaining
the scale-free nature.
